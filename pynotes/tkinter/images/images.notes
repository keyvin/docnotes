Images can be imported as BitmapImage objects or PhotoImage objects. You then attatch them to other objects, such as labels, buttons, etc

!!! You must hold on to the image object explicitly. No ifs ands or buts. If you do not, when the reference is gone, the image will be garbage collected
!!!So your widget will lose its image, probably throw a shitty error, and exit.
