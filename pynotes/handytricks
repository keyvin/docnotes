This is a handy one liner, because otherwise it wouldn't be very pretty. Be aware that dicts are unordered. 

generates a list of the values of a dictionary. Need to play with this...
vallist=list(dict.values())

for a dictionary, just iterate over as a list. 

for d in dicto:
    dicto[d]

what does list(d) do...

It generates a list of the keys.
