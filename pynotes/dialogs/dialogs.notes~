Two types of dialogs are common, modal and non modal. 

Modal - Block until they return, good for a file dialog, etc.

Nonmodal - Operate without any interaction from their parent, or the Tk() root object. 

Dialogs are implemented with the Toplevel widget. 

see dialog-modal.py 

!!!When you subclass a frame, make sure to call the mainloop(), or nothing will happen at all
